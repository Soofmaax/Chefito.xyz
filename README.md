# Chefito – AI Cooking Assistant (MVP)

Built solo by **Salwa Essafi (@Soofmaax)** for the Bolt Hackathon in **June 2025**.
This is an experimental first version with only **three demo recipes**.
AI routes, payments and the advanced voice assistant are placeholders and currently inactive.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev       # start the Next.js app
npm run read-recipe <id>  # CLI to print a recipe
```

Payments, Supabase auth and the Ollama assistant are disabled in this MVP.
This project remains in development and more features are planned for a future release.

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for the small set of variables used by the demo.
